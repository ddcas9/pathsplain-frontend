This project is currently just a fork of [@openspacelabs/react-native-zoomable-view](https://github.com/openspacelabs/react-native-zoomable-view). The hope is for it to become a way for pathologists to easily learn more about the less explainable features utilized in deep learning for pathology.

# Local Development
